## fNIRS to fMRI imaging projection

This is a simple script to project fNIRS channel data to fMRI MNI space. This script is modified from Dr. Cui. Now it can handle situations with multiple optodes set and a single channel set, avoiding the potential issue of excessive interpolation in the original script. I also provided tutorial about how to visualize projected fNIRS data with BrainNet Viewer.

The tutorial is in Chinese. If you need an English version, please contact me.

## fNIRS ISC toolbox

This is a small MATLAB toolbox to conduct Intersubject correlation(ISC) analysis on fNIRS data. I provided script to calculate ISC by leave-one-out way. And script to conduct phase-scramble ISCï¼Œ which used for multicomparison correction. Additionally, I also provided script to conduct Intersubject Representational Similarity Analysis (IS-RSA).
