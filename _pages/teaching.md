## The neural architecture of interpersonal cultural conflicts

*Poster, Cognitive Neuroscience Society annual meeting, 2024*

Download poster [here]()


## Interpersonal Neural Synchronization Analysis

*Course, Beijing Normal University, State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, 2021-2023*

This class is a part of Diffuse Optical Imaging for Brain Function course. In this class, I've talked how to analyse fNIRS-based hyperscaning data. Specifically, I teached how to perform cross-channel time-lagged Wavelet Transform Coherence at dyadic level, and how to conduct cluster-based permutation test at group level.

I provided my slides and a MATLAB demo [here](https://github.com/manipulative/fnirs_hyperscanning_tutorial). The slides are in Chinese. If you need an English version, please contact me.

## The naturalistic cognitive neuroscience

*Course, Sichuan Normal University, Institute of brain and psychologys, 2021-2023*

This class is a part of Progress in Psychology course. In this class, I talked the naturalistic paradigm in cognitive neuroscience. The naturalistic paradigm is an experiment method that contrasts with traditional laboratory experiments with strict controlled design. Generally, participants involves in watching a naturalistic film (like _Sherlock_) or engaging in a freely conversation. Here, I introduce the fundamental concepts, developmental history, basic methods, and typical studies of the naturalistic paradigm.

I provided my slides [here](https://manipulative/academicpages.github.io/files/naturalistic_cognitive_neuroscience.pdf). The slides are in Chinese. If you need an English version, please contact me.
