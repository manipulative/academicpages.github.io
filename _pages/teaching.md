## Interpersonal Neural Synchronization Analysis

*Course, Beijing Normal University, State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, 2021-2023*

This class is a part of Diffuse Optical Imaging for Brain Function course. In this class, I will teach you how to analyse fNIRS-based hyperscaning data. Specifically, I will teach how to perform cross-channel time-lagged Wavelet Transform Coherence at dyadic level, and how to conduct cluster-based permutation test at group level.

I provided my slides and a MATLAB demo [here](https://github.com/manipulative/fnirs_hyperscanning_tutorial). The slides are in Chinese. If you need an English version, please contact me.
