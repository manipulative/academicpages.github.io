I am an assistant researcher of Institute of Brain and Psychological Sciences at Sichuan Normal University. I completed a BA in psychology at Central China Normal University, and received my PhD degree in cognitive neuroscience from State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning at Beijing Normal University under the mentorship of Dr. Chunming Lu.  

My research focuses on understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying social interactions, ranging from intrapersonal, interpersonal to mass group perspectives. I am interested in why we can fluently communicate with different people and adjust our behavior flexibly in different contexts, as well as its neural representations and dynamics.

My technical pipeline combines naturalistic paradigm, hyperscaning technology and natural language process(NLP). I am also a novice in cognitive computational modeling.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research!
